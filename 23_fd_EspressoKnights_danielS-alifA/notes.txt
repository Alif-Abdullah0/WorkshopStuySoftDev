K23 - Building a Foundation

Time Elapsed: 1 hr

DISCO: 

QCC: 
Foundation appears to be lighter than Bootstrap to load, but with lesser features. I will say that the 
documentation for Bootstrap is more appealing and easier to read than with Foundation. 

I do not like the video based approach foundation tries to put onto readers of its website. I prefer snappier,
concise explanations of code, like Bootstrap has.

Q0: I had to use the foundation documentation extensively. The on-ramp page 
of my neigboring duo, though pleasant to look at, did not include the code they
used to construct the features they had on their page. 

Q1: I prefer Bootstrap. It's the framework I know about longer, and its the framework whose 
documentation seems easier to read. I can style pages quicker and better with Bootstrap than
I ever could with Foundation.
