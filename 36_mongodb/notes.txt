K36 -- Mongo Terminal Work
2022-04-30

I quite like the hands on work, especially in the realm
of terminal queries. For the longest time, I was conscious 
of how SQLite databases would scale to larger scale applications,
but I am glad MongoDB works as well as it does, since I have heard
it scales well with larger sets of data than SQLite does.
