K38 -- Mongo's Inferno
2022-05-15

This was quite the lengthy chapter, yet, at the end of it, I feel better 
equipped with Mongo then ever. I was considering never using MongoDB during this 
chapter's run through, but sitting where I am now, I can see this as a serious replacement
for SQLite. I am keeping Qina Liu's comments about using SQL vs NoSQL databases for 
certain scenarios in mind.
