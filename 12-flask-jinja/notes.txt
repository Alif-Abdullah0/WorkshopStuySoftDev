Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
It says render_template is not defined because you call render_template in the
test_templt() function, but that function is not defined.

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
It should, in theory, be localhost:5000/my_foist_template, or some variant of that.
It seems we are correct, in a sense. The url, in its entirety, is http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template.

Q2:
'model_tmplt.html' should, in theory, be the file name of the new template. foo="fooooo" should be the title of the webpage spun up in Flask,
and collection=coll should take in the data structure variable coll and use it in some way on the website.

After running the app, we are not too sure what occurred to 'model_tmplt.html,' but the contents of the coll data structure have been displayed on the 
locally hosted web site.
